When only one predictor is included in the model, the coefficient of determination is mathematically related to the Pearson’s correlation coefficient, r. Squaring the correlation coefficient results in the value of the coefficient of determination. The coefficient of determination can also be found with the following formula: R2 = MSS/TSS = (TSS − RSS)/TSS, where MSS is the model sum of squares (also known as ESS, or explained sum of squares), which is the sum of the squares of the prediction from the linear regression minus the mean for that variable; TSS is the total sum of squares associated with the outcome variable, which is the sum of the squares of the measurements minus their mean; and RSS is the residual sum of squares, which is the sum of the squares of the measurements minus the prediction from the linear regression.
