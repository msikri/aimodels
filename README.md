When only one predictor is included in the model, the coefficient of determination is mathematically related to the Pearson’s correlation coefficient, r. Squaring the correlation coefficient results in the value of the coefficient of determination. The coefficient of determination can also be found with the following formula: R2 = MSS/TSS = (TSS − RSS)/TSS, where MSS is the model sum of squares (also known as ESS, or explained sum of squares), which is the sum of the squares of the prediction from the linear regression minus the mean for that variable; TSS is the total sum of squares associated with the outcome variable, which is the sum of the squares of the measurements minus their mean; and RSS is the residual sum of squares, which is the sum of the squares of the measurements minus the prediction from the linear regression.
MSS: Model sum of squares
TSS: Total sum of squares

R2=1-MSS/TSS
Variability of y explained in model
Assumptions made in model 
y=a+bx
1.) Linearity

Linearity assumption is nor sufficient ( Reason)
We are trying to generalize for population from sample

There is an error in assumption of normal values so other assumptions are 
2.) Error terms are normally distributed
3.) Error terms are not independent of each other
4.) Error terms are indepedent not time series data where new value is dependent on previous values
5.) There is no assumption on distribution of x and y
6.) Error terms have const variance ( if this is not there then it will be unreliable)
